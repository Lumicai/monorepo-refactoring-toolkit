## üîß Integration Points Verified

### 1. Main Engine Integration
The optimized components are properly exported and available:

```typescript
import { 
  OptimizedDuplicateDetectionEngine,
  WorkerPoolManager,
  MemoryMonitor 
} from '@wundr/analysis-engine';
```

### 2. Configuration Support
Memory optimization settings are integrated:

```typescript
const config: AnalysisConfig = {
  useOptimizations: true,        // ‚úÖ Enabled
  maxMemoryUsage: 200 * 1024 * 1024, // ‚úÖ 200MB limit
  enableStreaming: true,         // ‚úÖ For large datasets
  // ... other config
};
```

### 3. Real Usage Example
```typescript
// Initialize optimized engine
const engine = new OptimizedDuplicateDetectionEngine({
  enableStreaming: true,
  maxMemoryUsage: 200 * 1024 * 1024,
  streamingBatchSize: 1000,
  enableSemanticAnalysis: true
});

// Start memory monitoring
const monitor = new MemoryMonitor({
  snapshotInterval: 5000,
  thresholds: { heapWarning: 100 * 1024 * 1024 }
});

await monitor.startMonitoring();

// Perform analysis
const results = await engine.analyze(entities, config);

// Get performance metrics
const metrics = engine.getMetrics();
console.log(`Cache hits: ${metrics.stats.cacheHits}`);
console.log(`Peak memory: ${metrics.stats.memoryPeakUsage / 1024 / 1024}MB`);
```
