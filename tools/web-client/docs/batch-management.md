# Batch Management System

## Overview

The Batch Management System provides a comprehensive interface for managing template consolidation operations through automated batch processing. This system enables users to create, monitor, and manage large-scale template operations efficiently.

## Features

### 1. Batch Processing Dashboard
- **Active Batches**: Real-time monitoring of running batch operations
- **Summary Cards**: Quick overview of system status
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators with detailed metrics
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error and warning display

### 2. Batch Creation Wizard
A 4-step guided process for creating new batch jobs:

#### Step 1: Basic Information
- Batch name and description
- Priority level (low, medium, high)

#### Step 2: Template Selection
- Consolidation type selection (merge, replace, archive)
- Template selection interface

#### Step 3: Configuration
- Backup strategy (automatic, manual, none)
- Conflict resolution (interactive, automatic, skip)

#### Step 4: Review & Schedule
- Summary of batch configuration
- Optional scheduling options
- Final review before creation

### 3. Progress Tracking
- **Real-time Updates**: Live progress monitoring
- **Detailed Metrics**: Templates processed, duplicates removed, conflicts resolved
- **Time Tracking**: Elapsed time and ETA calculations
- **Status Management**: Running, paused, completed, failed states

### 4. Batch History
- **Complete History**: All previous batch executions
- **Results Summary**: Detailed results for completed batches
- **Error Analysis**: Failure reasons and debugging information
- **Retry Capability**: Re-run failed batches

### 5. Rollback Capabilities
- **Safe Rollback**: Restore previous state for completed batches
- **Backup Integration**: Automatic backup creation before operations
- **Conflict Prevention**: Validation before rollback execution

### 6. Batch Scheduling
- **Automated Execution**: Schedule batches for later execution
- **Cron Support**: Flexible scheduling with cron expressions
- **Recurring Jobs**: Support for recurring batch operations
- **Schedule Management**: Enable/disable and manage scheduled jobs

## Components

### Main Components
- `BatchManagementPage`: Main page component
- `BatchProgressCard`: Individual batch progress display
- `useBatchManagement`: Custom hook for batch operations

### Key Files
- `/app/dashboard/templates/batches/page.tsx` - Main page
- `/hooks/use-batch-management.ts` - Data management hook
- `/components/batches/batch-progress-card.tsx` - Progress display component

## Data Models

### BatchJob
```typescript
interface BatchJob {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'paused';
  progress: number;
  templates: string[];
  consolidationType: 'merge' | 'replace' | 'archive';
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  // ... additional fields
}
```

### BatchSchedule
```typescript
interface BatchSchedule {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  cronExpression: string;
  enabled: boolean;
  // ... additional fields
}
```

## Usage

### Creating a Batch
1. Click "Create Batch" button
2. Follow the 4-step wizard
3. Configure templates and settings
4. Review and submit

### Monitoring Progress
- View active batches in the dashboard
- Click on individual batch cards for detailed progress
- Monitor real-time updates and status changes

### Managing History
- Access completed batches in the History tab
- View detailed results and metrics
- Retry failed batches or rollback completed ones

### Scheduling Batches
- Use the Scheduled tab to manage automated jobs
- Create recurring batch operations
- Enable/disable schedules as needed

## Integration

The batch management system integrates with:
- Template consolidation engine
- Backup and restore system
- Notification system
- Audit logging

## Performance Considerations

- Real-time updates use efficient polling mechanisms
- Large batch operations are chunked for better performance
- Progress tracking minimizes system overhead
- Rollback operations include safety validations

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced template selection filters
- Batch operation templates/presets
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Enhanced reporting and analytics
- Bulk batch operations
