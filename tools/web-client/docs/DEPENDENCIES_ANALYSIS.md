# Dependencies Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

The Dependencies Analysis page provides comprehensive insights into your project's dependencies, helping you identify outdated packages, security vulnerabilities, size impact, and optimization opportunities.

## Features

### 1. Dependency Graph Visualization
- **Interactive network diagram** showing dependency relationships
- **Multiple layout algorithms**: Force-directed, Circular, Hierarchical  
- **Node filtering** by dependency type (dependencies, devDependencies, peerDependencies)
- **Visual indicators** for package size and vulnerabilities
- **Click interactions** for detailed package information
- **Export functionality** to save visualizations

### 2. Package Version Analysis
- **Version tracking** comparing current vs. latest versions
- **Risk assessment** based on version age and update type
- **Update categorization**: patch, minor, major updates
- **Distribution charts** showing version staleness across the project
- **Migration guidance** with links to changelogs and guides

### 3. Security Vulnerability Scanning
- **Comprehensive vulnerability database** integration
- **Severity classification**: Critical, High, Moderate, Low
- **CVSS scoring** for standardized risk assessment
- **Patch availability** tracking with recommended actions
- **Remediation workflows** with automated fix commands
- **Security audit reports** with prioritized action items

### 4. Bundle Size Analysis
- **Size impact assessment** for each package
- **Bundle size estimation** after tree shaking and compression
- **Category classification**: Tiny (<50KB), Small, Medium, Large, Huge (>10MB)
- **Alternative suggestions** for oversized packages
- **Optimization recommendations** with implementation guides
- **Size distribution analysis** across the entire dependency tree

### 5. Outdated Packages Management
- **Comprehensive outdated package listing** with priority scoring
- **Bulk update commands** generation
- **Risk assessment** for breaking changes
- **Automated command generation** for npm/yarn updates
- **Batch selection** for targeted updates
- **Integration links** to changelogs and documentation

## Data Sources

The analysis integrates with multiple data sources:

- **package.json** - Current dependency versions and types
- **npm registry** - Latest versions and download statistics  
- **GitHub Security Advisory Database** - Vulnerability information
- **Package metadata** - Size information, maintainer data, licenses
- **Static analysis** - Dependency relationships and usage patterns

## Usage

### Navigation
Access the dependencies analysis through:
```
Dashboard → Analysis → Dependencies
```

### Key Workflows

#### Security Review
1. Navigate to the **Security Report** tab
2. Filter by **Critical** and **High** severity vulnerabilities
3. Review affected packages and available patches
4. Generate remediation commands from the **Remediation Guide**
5. Execute updates and re-run security audit

#### Size Optimization
1. Open the **Size Analysis** tab
2. Identify packages in the **Large** and **Huge** categories
3. Review alternative suggestions in the **Optimization Guide**
4. Implement tree shaking and dynamic imports as recommended
5. Monitor bundle size impact after changes

#### Dependency Updates
1. Go to the **Outdated Packages** tab
2. Filter by **Priority** (Critical/High first)
3. Select packages for bulk updates
4. Copy generated update commands
5. Test updates in development environment
6. Deploy after validation

#### Dependency Relationships
1. Use the **Dependency Graph** for visual exploration
2. Switch between layout algorithms for different perspectives
3. Click nodes for detailed package information
4. Filter by type to focus on specific dependency categories
5. Export visualizations for documentation

## Configuration

### Mock Data
The current implementation uses mock data to demonstrate functionality. In a production environment, this would be replaced with:

- **Real-time npm registry API calls**
- **GitHub Security Advisory API integration**
- **Package-lock.json/yarn.lock parsing**
- **Bundle analyzer integration**
- **Custom security scanning tools**

### Customization
The analysis can be customized through:

- **Filter presets** for different analysis scenarios
- **Threshold configuration** for risk scoring
- **Alternative package databases** for suggestions
- **Custom visualization layouts**
- **Export format options**

3. **Visualization Rendering**: Generate interactive charts and graphs
4. **User Interactions**: Filter, sort, and export functionality
5. **Action Generation**: Create actionable commands and recommendations

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Real-time vulnerability feeds** from multiple security databases
- **Automated dependency updates** with CI/CD integration
- **License compliance tracking** and reporting
- **Performance impact analysis** for runtime dependencies
- **Historical trend analysis** for dependency evolution
- **Team collaboration features** for update coordination

### Integration Opportunities
- **GitHub Actions** for automated security scanning

- **Package manager integration** for streamlined updates

## Best Practices

### Security
- **Regular vulnerability scanning** (weekly recommended)
- **Priority-based patching** focusing on critical/high severity
- **Testing protocols** for major version updates
- **Dependency pinning** for stable production deployments

### Performance
- **Bundle size monitoring** with automated alerts
- **Tree shaking optimization** for unused code elimination
- **Dynamic imports** for large optional dependencies
- **CDN externalization** for common libraries

### Maintenance
