# Dashboard Pages Audit Report
Generated: 2025-08-06

## Executive Summary
This audit identifies missing dashboard pages, broken links, and functionality gaps in the web-client dashboard application.

## 1. Pages Linked But Don't Exist (Broken Links)

### Critical Missing Pages:
1. **`/dashboard/analysis`** - Parent page for analysis section
   - Status: ❌ Missing (no page.tsx)
   - Referenced in: sidebar navigation
   - Impact: Users clicking "Analysis" get 404

### Pages with Incomplete Implementations:
1. **Visualizations Page** - Has both `page.tsx` and `page-new.tsx`
   - Status: ⚠️ Migration in progress
   - Files: `/dashboard/visualizations/page.tsx`, `/dashboard/visualizations/page-new.tsx`
   
2. **Recommendations Pages** - Multiple versions exist
   - Status: ⚠️ Migration in progress
   - Files with duplicates:
     - `/dashboard/recommendations/page.tsx` + `page-new.tsx`
     - `/dashboard/recommendations/critical/page.tsx` + `page-new.tsx`

3. **Main Dashboard** - Has duplicate implementation
   - Status: ⚠️ Migration in progress
   - Files: `/dashboard/page.tsx`, `/dashboard/page-new.tsx`

## 2. Pages That Should Exist (Based on Functionality)

### Missing UI for Existing API Endpoints:

1. **Code Scanning Dashboard** (`/dashboard/analysis/scan`)
   - API exists: `/api/analysis/scan`
   - Functionality: Real-time code scanning and analysis
   - Priority: High

2. **Service Health Monitor** (`/dashboard/services`)
   - API exists: `/api/services` (health, metrics, instances)
   - Functionality: Service orchestration monitoring
   - Priority: High

3. **Batch Processing Monitor** (`/dashboard/batches`)
   - API exists: `/api/batches` (active, history)
   - Functionality: Batch job monitoring and management
   - Priority: Medium
   - Note: Partially covered by `/dashboard/templates/batches`

4. **Script Execution History** (`/dashboard/scripts/history`)
   - API exists: `/api/scripts/executions`
   - Functionality: View past script executions and results
   - Priority: Medium

5. **Configuration Manager** (`/dashboard/config`)
   - API exists: `/api/config` (load, save)
   - Functionality: System configuration management
   - Priority: Medium

6. **WebSocket Monitor** (`/dashboard/monitor`)
   - API exists: `/api/websocket`
   - Functionality: Real-time system monitoring
   - Priority: Low

7. **Git Integration Dashboard** (`/dashboard/git`)
   - API exists: `/api/git`, `/api/git-activity`
   - Functionality: Git repository insights and activity
   - Priority: Medium

8. **Performance Analytics** (`/dashboard/performance`)
   - API exists: `/api/performance`
   - Hook exists: `use-performance-data.ts`
   - Priority: High

9. **Quality Metrics Dashboard** (`/dashboard/quality`)
   - API exists: `/api/quality`
   - Hook exists: `use-quality-metrics.ts`
   - Priority: High

10. **Report Export Center** (`/dashboard/reports/export`)
    - API exists: `/api/reports/export`
    - Functionality: Export reports in various formats
    - Priority: Medium

## 3. Hidden/Unlinked Pages

These pages exist but aren't in the main navigation:

1. **Logos Page** (`/dashboard/logos`)
   - Status: ✅ Exists but not linked
   - Purpose: Logo showcase/branding

2. **Scripts Page** (`/dashboard/scripts`)
   - Status: ✅ Exists but not linked in sidebar
   - Purpose: Script management and execution

## 4. Service Capabilities Without UI

Based on service analysis, these features lack dashboard pages:

1. **Execution Engine Dashboard**
   - Service: `ExecutionEngine.ts`
   - Suggested path: `/dashboard/execution`

2. **Template Management**
   - Service: `TemplateService.ts`
   - Current coverage: Partial (only batches and services)
   - Suggested: Unified template manager

3. **Report Generator**
   - Service: `report-service.ts`
   - API: `/api/reports/generate`
   - Suggested path: `/dashboard/reports/generate`

## 5. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1):
1. Create `/dashboard/analysis/page.tsx` landing page
2. Complete migration of pages with `page-new.tsx` versions
3. Add Performance Analytics dashboard
4. Add Quality Metrics dashboard

### Short-term (Priority 2):
1. Implement Service Health Monitor
2. Create unified Script Execution History page
3. Add Git Integration Dashboard
4. Link Scripts page to sidebar navigation

### Long-term (Priority 3):
1. Build Configuration Manager UI
2. Create WebSocket monitoring dashboard
3. Implement comprehensive Report Generation UI
4. Add Execution Engine dashboard

## 6. Technical Debt

### File Organization Issues:
- Multiple `page-new.tsx` files indicate incomplete refactoring
- Inconsistent page structure between sections
- Some API endpoints lack corresponding UI components

### Navigation Consistency:
- Scripts page exists but not in sidebar
- Logos page exists but not linked
- Analysis parent page missing

## 7. Quick Wins

1. **Add missing parent page** for `/dashboard/analysis`
2. **Link existing pages** (Scripts, Logos) to navigation
3. **Complete page migrations** (remove page-new.tsx duplicates)
4. **Add redirects** for common navigation patterns

## Conclusion

The dashboard has 10+ missing pages that should exist based on available API endpoints and services. Additionally, there are 3-4 pages in migration state with duplicate implementations. Priority should be given to creating the missing Analysis parent page and completing the ongoing page migrations.
