### Frontend Framework
1. **Next.js 15 with React 19** (Selected)
2. Vue.js 3 with Nuxt.js
3. SvelteKit
4. Angular 17

### Backend Framework
1. **Node.js with Fastify** (Selected)
2. Node.js with Express
3. Python with FastAPI
4. Go with Gin/Echo

### Database
1. **PostgreSQL 15** (Selected)
2. MySQL 8
3. MongoDB
4. CockroachDB

### Caching
1. **Redis 7** (Selected)
2. Memcached
3. In-memory caching only

### Build System
1. **Turborepo** (Selected)
2. Nx
3. Lerna
4. Rush

## Decision

### Frontend Stack
- **Next.js 15** with App Router for SSR/SSG capabilities
- **React 19** for UI components with concurrent features
- **TypeScript 5.2+** for type safety across the entire frontend
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Shadcn/ui** for consistent component library
- **Recharts** for data visualization

### Backend Stack
- **Node.js 18+** as the runtime environment
- **Fastify 4** as the web framework for performance
- **TypeScript 5.2+** for type-safe server development
- **GraphQL with Apollo Server** for flexible API queries
- **Socket.io** for real-time WebSocket connections
- **Bull Queue** for background job processing

### Database Stack
- **PostgreSQL 15** as the primary database
- **Redis 7** for caching and session management
- **Prisma ORM** for database access and migrations
- **PgBouncer** for connection pooling

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Kubernetes** for orchestration (production)
- **Turborepo** for monorepo build management
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipeline
- **Vercel** for frontend deployment
- **AWS/GCP** for backend infrastructure

### Development Tools
- **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code quality
- **Jest** and **Vitest** for testing
- **Playwright** for end-to-end testing
- **Storybook** for component development
- **Husky** for git hooks

## Rationale

### Next.js 15 + React 19
- **Performance**: App Router provides excellent SSR/SSG performance
- **Developer Experience**: Best-in-class developer tools and debugging
- **Ecosystem**: Massive ecosystem with community support
- **Type Safety**: Excellent TypeScript integration
- **Concurrent Features**: React 19's concurrent features for better UX

### Fastify over Express
- **Performance**: 2-3x faster than Express in benchmarks
- **TypeScript Support**: Native TypeScript support and excellent typing
- **Plugin System**: Rich plugin ecosystem for extensibility
- **JSON Schema**: Built-in validation and serialization
- **Modern Architecture**: Designed with modern Node.js features

### PostgreSQL over NoSQL
- **ACID Compliance**: Strong consistency for critical business data
- **Complex Queries**: Superior support for complex analytical queries
- **JSON Support**: Native JSONB support for flexible data
- **Performance**: Excellent performance with proper indexing
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of tools and extensions

### Turborepo over Nx
- **Simplicity**: Simpler configuration and mental model
- **Performance**: Excellent build caching and parallelization
- **Vercel Integration**: Native integration with Vercel deployment
- **TypeScript First**: Designed specifically for TypeScript monorepos
- **Developer Experience**: Superior developer experience for our use case

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Unified Language**: TypeScript across frontend and backend reduces context switching
- **Performance**: Excellent performance characteristics for our use cases
- **Developer Productivity**: Modern tooling significantly improves developer experience
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports both vertical and horizontal scaling
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety reduces bugs and improves maintainability
- **Community**: Large communities ensure long-term support and resources

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Fastify, Next.js App Router, and Turborepo
- **Complexity**: Monorepo setup adds initial complexity
- **Bundle Size**: React and associated libraries increase frontend bundle size
- **Memory Usage**: Node.js applications typically use more memory than compiled languages

### Risks and Mitigation

#### Risk: Performance bottlenecks in Node.js
**Mitigation**: 
- Use worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Consider microservices for compute-heavy operations

#### Risk: PostgreSQL scaling limitations
**Mitigation**:
- Implement read replicas for scaling reads
- Use connection pooling (PgBouncer)
- Consider partitioning for large tables

#### Risk: Frontend bundle size
**Mitigation**:
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Use Next.js built-in optimizations
- Regular bundle analysis and optimization

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
1. Set up Turborepo monorepo structure
2. Configure TypeScript across all packages
3. Set up basic Next.js application
4. Configure Fastify backend with basic routes

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (Weeks 3-4)
1. Set up PostgreSQL with Prisma
