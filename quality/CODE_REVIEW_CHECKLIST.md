# Code Review Checklist

This comprehensive checklist ensures consistent code quality across the monorepo refactoring toolkit.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

### Service Layer

- [ ] Observer pattern is used for event handling

### Dependencies
- [ ] No circular import dependencies
- [ ] Dependencies are injected, not hardcoded

## 📊 Performance & Optimization

### Code Efficiency
- [ ] No obvious performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Database queries are optimized
- [ ] Large datasets are processed in batches
- [ ] Unnecessary computations are avoided
- [ ] Memory leaks are prevented (event listeners cleaned up)

### Async Operations
- [ ] Async method names start with verbs (get, fetch, save, etc.)
- [ ] Promise chains are properly handled
- [ ] Concurrent operations use Promise.all() where appropriate
- [ ] Timeouts are set for external API calls
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented for external services

## 🔒 Security

### Input Validation
- [ ] All user inputs are validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevention measures in place
- [ ] XSS prevention for web interfaces
- [ ] Path traversal attacks prevented
- [ ] File upload restrictions enforced

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Authentication is required for protected endpoints
- [ ] Authorization checks are performed at appropriate levels
- [ ] Secrets are not hardcoded in source code
- [ ] Environment variables are used for configuration
- [ ] Sensitive data is properly encrypted

### Data Protection
- [ ] Personal data is handled according to privacy policies
- [ ] Audit logs are created for sensitive operations
- [ ] Data is validated before processing
- [ ] Temporary files are cleaned up
- [ ] Database connections are properly closed

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Coverage
- [ ] New code has appropriate test coverage (minimum 80%)
- [ ] Unit tests cover both happy path and edge cases
- [ ] Integration tests validate service interactions
- [ ] Mock objects are used appropriately
- [ ] Test data is isolated and independent

### Test Quality
- [ ] Tests have descriptive names
- [ ] Tests are independent and can run in any order
- [ ] Tests clean up after themselves
- [ ] Flaky tests are fixed or removed
- [ ] Performance tests exist for critical paths

## 📋 TypeScript Specific

### Type Safety
- [ ] No `any` types without justification
- [ ] Proper type definitions for all public APIs
- [ ] Generic types are used appropriately
- [ ] Union types are preferred over any where applicable
- [ ] Strict TypeScript configuration is followed

### Interfaces & Types
- [ ] Interfaces are used for object contracts
- [ ] Types are defined for complex data structures
- [ ] Enum values are not duplicated
- [ ] Optional properties are marked correctly
- [ ] Return types are explicitly defined for public methods

## 🔧 Tooling & Configuration

### Linting & Formatting
- [ ] ESLint rules are followed
- [ ] Prettier formatting is applied
- [ ] Custom ESLint rules are not violated
- [ ] Import statements follow organization rules
- [ ] File length limits are respected (300 lines max)

### Build & CI/CD
- [ ] Code compiles without warnings
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No breaking changes to public APIs
- [ ] Changelog is updated for significant changes
- [ ] Version numbers follow semantic versioning

## 📁 File Organization

### File Structure
- [ ] Files are in appropriate directories
- [ ] File names follow naming conventions
- [ ] Related files are grouped together
- [ ] No files exceed maximum line count (300 lines)
- [ ] Executable scripts have proper permissions

### Import/Export
- [ ] Exports are used appropriately (named vs default)
- [ ] No unused imports or exports
- [ ] Import paths are clean and relative where appropriate
- [ ] Barrel exports are used for module organization

## 🚀 Monorepo Specific

### Package Organization
- [ ] Code is in the correct package
- [ ] Package dependencies are declared correctly
- [ ] No cross-package imports that violate architecture
- [ ] Shared code is in appropriate shared packages
- [ ] Package.json files are up to date

### Build Dependencies
- [ ] Build scripts work correctly
- [ ] Dependencies between packages are correct
- [ ] No circular package dependencies
- [ ] Workspace configuration is updated if needed

## 📝 Documentation

### Code Documentation
- [ ] Public APIs have complete JSDoc
- [ ] Complex algorithms are explained
- [ ] Configuration options are documented
- [ ] Examples are provided for usage
- [ ] Breaking changes are highlighted

### External Documentation
- [ ] README files are updated
- [ ] API documentation is generated
- [ ] Migration guides are provided if needed
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides are updated
- [ ] Architecture diagrams reflect changes

## ✅ Pre-Merge Checklist

Before approving any pull request, ensure:

- [ ] All automated checks pass (CI/CD, linting, tests)
- [ ] Code has been manually reviewed by at least one team member
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Performance impact has been considered
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate

- [ ] Migration path is provided for breaking changes

## 🎯 Quality Gates

### Must Fix (Blocking)
- Security vulnerabilities
- Breaking changes without migration path
- Test failures
- Linting errors (not warnings)
- Critical performance regressions

### Should Fix (Non-blocking but important)
- Code smells and anti-patterns
- Missing documentation
- Test coverage below 80%
- Overly complex functions (complexity > 10)
- Unused code

### Nice to Have (Improvements)
- Better variable names
- Additional test cases
- Performance optimizations
- Code refactoring for readability

## 📊 Review Metrics

Track these metrics to improve code review process:

- Average time to first review
- Number of review cycles per PR
- Percentage of PRs that require major changes
- Most common issues found in reviews
