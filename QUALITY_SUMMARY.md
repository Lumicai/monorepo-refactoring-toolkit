## 🔧 Quality Improvements by Category

### 1. Code Consistency
```typescript
// Before: Inconsistent error handling
throw new Error('Something went wrong');

// After: Standardized error handling
throw new AppError('Specific error description', 'ERROR_CODE');
```

### 2. Security Hardening
```typescript
// Before: Hardcoded values
const port = 8080;
const timeout = 30000;

// After: Environment-based configuration
const port = SERVER_CONFIG.DEFAULT_PORT;
const timeout = SERVER_CONFIG.TIMEOUT;
```

### 3. Performance Optimization
```typescript
// Before: Sequential processing
for (const file of files) {
  await processFile(file);
}

// After: Controlled parallel processing
await Promise.all(
  files.map(file => semaphore.acquire().then(() =>
    processFile(file).finally(() => semaphore.release())
  ))
);
```

### 4. Documentation Enhancement
