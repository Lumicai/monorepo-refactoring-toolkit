## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. GitHub repository with Actions enabled
2. Required secrets configured (NPM_TOKEN, cloud provider credentials)
3. Team structure set up for code reviews
4. Domain and SSL certificates for production deployment

### Quick Setup
1. **Configure secrets** in repository settings
2. **Run branch protection workflow** to apply repository settings
3. **Create first changeset** to test release pipeline
4. **Trigger deployment** to staging environment
5. **Monitor workflows** and adjust configuration as needed

### First Release
```bash
# Create a changeset
npx changeset
# Describe your changes and select semver level

# Commit and push
git add .changeset/
git commit -m "feat: initial CI/CD pipeline"
git push

# Merge the generated release PR when ready
```
